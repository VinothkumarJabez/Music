 'Cause you're a sky, 'cause you're a sky full of stars
 I'm gonna give you my heart
 'Cause you're a sky, 'cause you're a sky full of stars
 'Cause you light up the path

 I don't care, go on and tear me apart
 I don't care if you do, ooh
 'Cause in a sky, 'cause in a sky full of stars
 I think I saw you

 'Cause you're a sky, 'cause you're a sky full of stars
 I wanna die in your arms
 'Cause you get lighter the more it gets dark
 I'm gonna give you my heart

 I don't care, go on and tear me apart
 I don't care if you do, ooh
 'Cause in a sky, 'cause in a sky full of stars
 I think I see you
 I think I see you

 'Cause you're a sky, you're a sky full of stars
 Such a heavenly view
 You're such a heavenly view
 ""","""

Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh

Can you feel me
When I think about you?
With every breath I take
Every minute
No matter what I do

My world is an empty place
Like I've been wandering the desert
For a thousand days (oh)
Don't know if it's a mirage
But I always see your face, baby

I'm missing you so much
Can't help it, I'm in love
A day without you is like a year without rain
I need you by my side
Don't know how I'll survive
A day without you is like a year without rain
Whoa, oh, whoa

The stars are burning
I hear your voice in my mind (voice in my mind)
Can't you hear me calling?
My heart is yearning
Like the ocean that's running dry
Catch me, I'm falling

It's like the ground is crumbling underneath my feet
Won't you save me?
There's gonna be a monsoon when you get back to me, oh, baby

I'm missing you so much
Can't help it, I'm in love
A day without you is like a year without rain
I need you by my side
Don't know how I'll survive
A day without you is like a year without rain
Whoa, oh, whoa

So let this drought come to an end
And make this desert flower again
I'm so glad you found me
Stick around me,
Baby baby baby oooh

It's a world of wonder with you in my life
So hurry, baby, don't waste no more time
I need you here, I can't explain
But a day without you is like a year without rain (oh, whoa)

I'm missing you so much
Can't help it, I'm in love
A day without you is like a year without rain
I need you by my side
Don't know how I'll survive
A day without you is like a year without rain
Whoa, oh, whoa

Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh

What's the trick? I wish I knew
I'm so done with thinking through
All the things I could've been
And I know you wonder too

All it takes is that one look you do
And I run right back to you
You crossed the line
And it's time to say "F... you"

What's the point in saying that
When you know how I'll react?
You think you can just take it back
But shit just don't work like that

You're the drug that I'm addicted to
And I want you so bad
Guess I'm stuck with you
And that's that

'Cause when it all falls down
Then whatever
When it don't work out
For the better
If it just ain't right
And it's time to say goodbye
When it all falls down
When it all falls down

I'll be fine, I'll be fine
You're the drug that I'm addicted to
And I want you so bad, but I'll be fine

Why we fight? I don't know
We say what hurts the most
Oh, I try staying cold
But you take it personal

All these firing shots
And making ground
It's way too hard to cope
But I still can't let you go

'Cause when it all falls down
Then whatever
When it don't work out
For the better
If it just ain't right
And it's time to say goodbye
When it all falls down
When it all falls down

I'll be fine, I'll be fine
You're the drug that I'm addicted to
And I want you so bad, but I'll be fine

I'll be fine, fine
(All falls down)
I'll be fine, fine, fine
I fine, fine, fine, fine
(Falling down)
(All falls down)
I'll be fine, fine, fine

I fine, fine, fine, fine
(All falls down)
I'll be fine, fine, fine
I fine, fine, fine, fine
(Falling down)
(All falls down)
I'll be fine, fine, fine
I fine, fine

'Cause when it all falls down
Then whatever
(Then whatever, babe)
When it don't work out
For the better
(For the better)
If it just ain't right
(If it just ain't right)
And it's time to say goodbye
When it all falls down
(When it all, when it all)
When it all falls down
(When it all falls down)

I'll be fine (Fine, fine, fine)
I'll be fine (I'll be fine)
You're the drug that I'm addicted to and I want you so bad
But I'll be fine (I'll be fine), and that's that

We were young
Posters on the wall
Praying we're the ones
That the teacher wouldn't call
We would stare at each other
'Cause we were always in trouble

And all the cool kids
Did their own thing
I was on the outside
Always looking in
Yeah, I was there but I wasn't
They never really cared if I wasn't

We all need that someone
Who gets you like no one else
Right when you need it the most
We all need a soul to rely on
A shoulder to cry on
A friend through the highs and the lows

I'm not gonna make it alone
La la la la la la
La la la la la –lone
I'm not gonna make it alone
La la la la la la
La la la la la –lone

Then I saw your face
Your forgiving eyes
Looking back at me
From the other side
Like you understood me
And I'm never letting you go, oh

We all need that someone
Who gets you like no one else
Right when you need it the most
We all need a soul to rely on
A shoulder to cry on
A friend through the highs and the lows

I'm not gonna make it alone
La la la la la la
La la la la la –lone
I'm not gonna make it alone
La la la la la la
La la la la la –lone

I'm not gonna make it alone
La la la la la la
La la la la la –lone
I'm not gonna make it alone
La la la la la la
La la la la la –lone

I'm not gonna make it alone
La la la la la la –lone
I'm not gonna make it alone
La la la la la la
La la la la la –lone

'Cause you are that someone
That gets me like no one else
Right when I need it the most
And I'll be the one you rely on
Your shoulder to cry on
A friend through the highs and the lows

I'm not gonna make it alone
La la la la la la
La la la la la la –lone
I'm not gonna make it alone
La la la la la la
La la la la la la –lone

I'm not gonna make it alone

Lost in your mind
I wanna know
Am I losing my mind?
Never let me go

If this night is not forever
At least we are together
I know I'm not alone
I know I'm not alone
Anywhere, whenever
Apart, but still together
I know I'm not alone
I know I'm not alone

I know I'm not alone
I know I'm not alone

Unconscious mind
I'm wide awake
Wanna feel one last time
Take my pain away

If this night is not forever
At least we are together
I know I'm not alone
I know I'm not alone
Anywhere, whenever
Apart, but still together
I know I'm not alone
I know I'm not alone

I know I'm not alone
I know I'm not alone

I'm not alone, I'm not alone
I'm not alone, I know I'm not alone
I'm not alone, I'm not alone
I'm not alone, I know I'm not alone

You know you love me, I know you care
Just shout whenever, and I'll be there
You are my love, you are my heart
And we will never ever ever be apart

Are we an item? Girl, quit playing
We're just friends, what are you saying?
Said there's another and looked right in my eyes
My first love broke my heart for the first time
And I was like...

Baby, baby, baby oooh
Like baby, baby, baby nooo
Like baby, baby, baby oooh
I thought you'd always be mine (mine)

Baby, baby, baby oooh
Like baby, baby, baby nooo

Oh, for you I would have done whatever
And I just can't believe we ain't together
And I wanna play it cool, but I'm losin' you
I'll buy you anything, I'll buy you any ring
And I'm in pieces, baby fix me
And just shake me 'til you wake me from this bad dream
I'm going down, down, down, down
And I just can't believe my first love won't be around

And I'm like
Baby, baby, baby oooh
Like baby, baby, baby nooo
Like baby, baby, baby oooh
I thought you'd always be mine (mine)

Baby, baby, baby oooh
Like baby, baby, baby nooo
Like baby, baby, baby oooh
I thought you'd always be mine (mine)

[Ludacris:]
Luda! When I was 13, I had my first love
There was nobody that compared to my baby
And nobody came between us or could ever come above
She had me going crazy, oh, I was star-struck
She woke me up daily, don't need no Starbucks
She made my heart pound, and skip a beat when I see her in the street and
At school on the playground but I really wanna see her on the weekend
She knows she got me dazing cause she was so amazing
And now my heart is breaking but I just keep on saying...

Baby, baby, baby oooh
Like baby, baby, baby nooo
Like baby, baby, baby oooh
I thought you'd always be mine (mine)

Baby, baby, baby oooh
Like baby, baby, baby nooo

Now I'm all gone (Yeah Yeah Yeah, Yeah Yeah Yeah)
Now I'm all gone (Yeah Yeah Yeah, Yeah Yeah Yeah)
Now I'm all gone (gone, gone, gone...)

Glittering starlight
Building with blinking light
We're shining
In each room's own star

Some light is ambition
Some light wandering
The lights of people
A precious one

Dark night (do not be lonely)
Like a star (We shine)
Do not disappear
It's because it's a big existence
Let us shine

The reason this night's expression is so beautiful again
Those stars, those lights, no it's probably because of us

You got me
I dream while looking at you
I got you
In the nights that are pitch black
Each other's light that we saw
We were saying the same thing

Starlight shining brighter than the darkest night
Starlight shining brighter than the darkest night
The later the night gets, the brighter the starlight

One history in one person
One star in one person
Shining with 7 billion lights
7 billion worlds

The night view of seven billion living cities
Maybe another city's night
Our individual dreams, let us shine
You shine brighter than anyone
One

How beautiful this night look is so beautiful again
That darkness is not moonlight, it's us

You got me
I dream of you
I got you
In the dark night
Each other's light
We were saying the same thing

Starlight shining brighter than the darkest night
Starlight shining brighter than the darkest night
The later the night gets, the brighter the starlight

City lights, stars of this city
I remember the night sky I saw in my childhood
Lights called people, by stars called people
This place that is full of them
We shinin'

You got me
I breathe while looking at you
I got you
In the nights that are pitch black

Shine, dream, smile
Oh let us light up the night
We shine in our own way
Shine, dream, smile
Oh let us light up the night
All we need is to shine
Tonight

This is gonna hurt
But I blame myself first
'Cause I ignored the truth
Drunk off that love
It fucked my head up
There's no forgetting you

You've awoken me
But you're choking me
I was so obsessed
Gave you all of me
And now honestly
I've got nothing left

I loved you dangerously
More than the air that I breathe
Knew we would crash at the speed that we were going
Didn't care if the explosion ruined me
Baby, I loved you dangerously
I loved you dangerously

Usually I hold
The power with both
My hands tied behind my back
Look at how things changed
'Cause now you're the train
And I'm tied to the track

You've awoken me
But you're choking me
I was so obsessed
Gave you all of me
And now honestly
I've got nothing left

'Cause I loved you dangerously
More than the air that I breathe
Knew we would crash at the speed that we were going
Didn't care if the explosion ruined me
Baby, I loved you dangerously

You took me down, down, down, down
And kissed my lips with goodbye
I see it now, now, now, now
It was a matter of time
You know I know
There's only one place this could lead
But you are the fire
I'm gasoline

I love you, I love you, I love you

I loved you dangerously
More than the air that I breathe
Oh now, knew we would crash at the speed that we were going
Didn't care if the explosion ruined me
Oh, oh, baby, I loved you dangerously

Oh, I loved you dangerously
Oh, oh, I loved you dangerously

We're not in love
We share no stories
Just something in your eyes
Don't be afraid
The shadows know me
Let's leave the world behind

Take me through the night
Fall into the dark side
We don't need the light
We'll live on the dark side
I see it
Let's feel it
While we're still young and fearless
Let go of the light
Fall into the dark side
Fall into the dark side
Give in to the dark side
Let go of the light
Fall into the dark side

Beneath the sky
As black as diamonds
We're running out of time
Don't wait for the truth
To come and blind us
Let's just believe their lies

Believe it, I see it
I know that you can feel it
No secrets worth keeping
So fool me like I'm dreaming

Take me through the night
Fall into the dark side

So thankful for that, it's such a blessin', yeah
Turn every situation into Heaven, yeah
Oh, you are my sunrise on the darkest day
Got me feelin' some kind of way
Make me wanna savour every moment slowly, slowly

The only words I wanna hear

Despacito
Quiero respirar tu cuello despacito

Quiero ser tu ritmo

Hasta provocar tus gritos
Y que olvides tu apellido

Si te pido un beso, ven, dámelo
Yo sé que estás pensándolo
Llevo tiempo intentándolo
Mami, esto es dando y dándolo
Sabes que tu corazón conmigo te hace bang-bang
Sabes que esa beba está buscando de mi bang-bang
Ven, prueba de mi boca para ver cómo te sabe
Quiero, quiero, quiero ver cuánto amor a ti te cabe
Yo no tengo prisa, yo me quiero dar el viaje
Empecemos lento, después salvaje

Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito

Cuando tú me besas con esa destreza
Veo que eres malicia con delicadeza

Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito

Y es que esa belleza es un rompecabezas
Pero pa' montarlo aquí tengo la pieza
¡Oye!

Did you feel us?
Another star
You fade away
Afraid our aim is out of sight
Wanna see us

Eternal silence of the sea, I'm breathing
Alive

She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just want to dance"

I met her on Grafton street right outside of the bar
She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar
She asked me what does it mean the Gaelic ink on your arm?
Said it was one of my friend's songs do you want to drink on?

She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun
She got Arthur on the table, with Johnny riding as shotgun
Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar
Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance, you know

She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just want to dance"

With my pretty little Galway Girl
You're my pretty little Galway Girl

You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool
And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room
As last orders were called, was when she stood on the stool
After dancing to Cèilidh, singing to trad tunes
I never heard Carrickfergus ever sung so sweet
Acapella in the bar using her feet for a beat
Oh I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week
And in this packed out room, swear she was singing to me, you know

She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just want to dance"

My pretty little Galway girl
My my my my my my my Galway girl
My my my my my my my Galway girl
My my my my my my my Galway girl

Now we've outstayed our welcome and it's closing time
I was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine
Our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine
As we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night

I walked her home then she took me inside
Finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine
I swear I'm going to put you in a song that I write
About a Galway girl and a perfect night

She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just want to dance"

My pretty little Galway girl
My my my my my my my Galway girl
My my my my my my my Galway girl
My my my my my my my Galway girl

I used to believe
We were burnin' on the edge of somethin' beautiful
Somethin' beautiful
Sellin' a dream
Smoke and mirrors keep us waiting on a miracle
On a miracle

Say, go through the darkest of days
Heaven is a heartbreak away
Never let you go, never let me down
Oh, it's been a hell of a ride
Driving the edge of a knife
Never let you go, never let me down

Don't you give up, nah-nah-nah
I won't give up, nah-nah-nah
Let me love you

Don't fall asleep
At the wheel, we've got a million miles ahead of us
Miles ahead of us
All that we need
Is a rude awakening to know we're good enough
Know we're good enough

Say go through the darkest of days
Heaven is a heartbreak away
Never let you go, never let me down

Never knew that it could mean so much, so much

I'm sorry but
Don't wanna talk
I need a moment before I go
It's nothing personal

I draw the blinds
They don't need to see me cry
'Cause even if they understand
They don't understand

So then when I'm finished
I'm all 'bout my business
And ready to save the world
I'm taking my misery
Make it my bitch
Can't be everyone's favorite girl

So take aim and fire away
I've never been so wide awake
No, nobody but me can keep me safe
And I'm on my way
The blood moon is on the rise
The fire burning in my eyes
No, nobody but me can keep me safe

Lo siento mucho (Farru), pero me voy (Eh)
Porque a tu lado me di cuenta que nada soy (Eh-ey)

De estar en la línea de fuego y de meter la mano
Acepto mis errore', también soy humano
Y tú no ve' que lo hago porque te amo (Pum-pum-pum-pum)

Pero ya (Ya) no tengo más na' que hacer aquí (Aquí)
Me voy, llegó la hora 'e partir (Partir)
De mi propio camino, seguir lejos de ti

I found a love for me
Oh darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time
But darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holding mine

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight

[Beyonce:]
Well I found a man, stronger than anyone I know
He shares my dreams, I hope that someday we'll share a home
I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own
We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fighting against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be your girl, you'll be my man
And I see my future in your eyes

Well baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass
[Beyonce & Ed Sheeran:]
While listening to our favorite song
When I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful
I don't deserve this, darling, you look perfect tonight

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, while listening to our favorite song
I have faith in what I see
Now I know I have met an angel in person
And she looks perfect
And he looks perfect
No I don't deserve this

And trust me I'll give it a chance now (mmmm)

Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate (mmmm)

And Batman with his fists
And clearly I don't see myself upon that list

But she said, "Where'd you wanna go?
How much you wanna risk?
I'm not looking for somebody
With some superhuman gifts
Some superhero
Some fairytale bliss
Just something I can turn to
Somebody I can kiss
I want something just like this"

Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Oh, I want something just like this
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo

Oh, I want something just like this
I want something just like this

I've been reading books of old
The legends and the myths
The testaments they told
The moon and its eclipse
And Superman unrolls
A suit before he lifts
But I'm not the kind of person that it fits

She said, "Where'd you wanna go?
How much you wanna risk?
I'm not looking for somebody
With some superhuman gifts
Some superhero
Some fairytale bliss
Just something I can turn to
Somebody I can miss
I want something just like this
I want something just like this"

Oh, I want something just like this
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Oh, I want something just like this
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo

Where'd you wanna go?
How much you wanna risk?
I'm not looking for somebody
With some superhuman gifts
Some superhero
Some fairytale bliss
Just something I can turn to
Somebody I can kiss
I want something just like this

Oh, I want something just like this
Oh, I want something just like this
Oh, I want something just like this

Hello, hello
Can you hear me
As I scream your name
Hello, hello
Do you need me, before I fade away

Is this a place that I call home
To find what I've become
Walk along the path unknown
We live, we love, we lie

Deep in the dark
I don't need the light
There's a ghost inside me
It all belongs to the other side
We live, we love, we lie

(We live, we love, we lie)

Hello, hello
Nice to meet you, voice inside my head
Hello, hello
I believe you, how can I forget

Is this a place that I call home
To find what I've become
Walk along the path unknown
We live, we love, we lie

Deep in the dark
I don't need the light
There's a ghost inside me
It all belongs to the other side
We live, we love, we lie

(We live, we love, we lie)

We live, we love, we lie

We don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore
Like we used to do
We don't laugh anymore
What was all of it for?
Oh, we don't talk anymore
Like we used to do

I just heard you found the one you've been looking—
You've been looking for
I wish I would have known that wasn't me
'Cause even after all this time I still wonder
Why I can't move on
Just the way you did so easily

Don't wanna know
Kind of dress you're wearing tonight
If he's holdin' onto you so tight
The way I did before
I overdosed
Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't get you out of my brain
Oh, it's such a shame

That we don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore
Like we used to do
We don't laugh anymore
What was all of it for?
Oh, we don't talk anymore
Like we used to do

[Selena Gomez:]
I just hope you're lying next to somebody
Who knows how to love you like me
There must be a good reason that you're gone
Every now and then I think you might want me to
Come show up at your door
But I'm just too afraid that I'll be wrong

Don't wanna know
If you're looking into her eyes
If she's holdin' onto you so tight
The way I did before
I overdosed
Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't get you out of my brain
Oh, it's such a shame

[Charlie Puth & Selena Gomez:]
That we don't talk anymore
(we don't, we don't)
We don't talk anymore
(we don't, we don't)
We don't talk anymore
Like we used to do
We don't laugh anymore
(we don't, we don't)
What was all of it for?
(we don't, we don't)
Oh, we don't talk anymore
Like we used to do

Like we used to do

Don't wanna know
Kind of dress you're wearing tonight
If he's giving it to you just right
The way I did before
I overdosed
Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't get you out of my brain
Oh, it's such a shame

That we don't talk anymore
(we don't, we don't)
We don't talk anymore
(we don't, we don't)
We don't talk anymore
Like we used to do
We don't laugh anymore
(we don't, we don't)
What was all of it for?
(we don't, we don't)
Oh, we don't talk anymore
Like we used to do

We don't talk anymore

Don't wanna know
Kind of dress you're wearing tonight, oh
If he's holding onto you so tight, oh
The way I did before

We don't talk anymore

I overdosed
Should've known your love was a game, oh
Now I can't get you out of my brain, whoa
Oh, it's such a shame

That we don't talk anymore
